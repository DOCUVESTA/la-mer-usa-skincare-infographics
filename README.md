## Overview
Who doesn't love neat, themed, and aesthetically pleasing infographics, especially when they're automatically generated. I know I do! This La Mer skincare-themed infographic PDF utilizes data from the brand's website to provide key details on their top-selling products in the USA. This includes a bar plot showing the age distribution of customers who left reviews on one of the 19 best-selling products, along with information on the highest rated, most rated, lowest rated, and least rated products as of Thursday, May 30, 2024.
